Welcome! I'm starting this blog as a companion to my [Substack](https://substack.com) newsletter. Here I'll be writing about science, scientific careers, and the things I've learned during my PhD at the Salk Institute.

## What to expect

I plan to write about:

- **Research insights** — accessible explanations of epigenetics, chromatin biology, and immunology
- **PhD life** — lessons learned, advice for prospective and current graduate students
- **Scientific careers** — navigating academia, industry, and everything in between
- **Tools and methods** — computational and experimental approaches I find useful

## Why a blog *and* a Substack?

I want the best of both worlds: Substack's built-in audience and email delivery, plus a permanent home for my writing on my own site. Each post lives in both places, with canonical links to keep everything connected.

Stay tuned for more — and feel free to reach out if there's a topic you'd like me to cover.
